# cpp_SnakeGame
Snake Game built in C++, graphics provided by OpenGL. The graphics files were written by Daniel Morwood. Snake folder contains all of the OpenGL libraries and code. Snake_mac file contains the code for running on a Mac.

I have listed the main function separately so one doesn't have to search through the file system to find the main.cpp file. This snake.cpp version of the snake game is for Windows. It was created in Visual Studio 2017 and I also run it in VS2017.

The main function for the Mac version is also listed separately. The code was written in XCode and built and run in XCode. You can find the Mac version of the game in the Snake Game 3 folder. I tried renaming the folder but it was breaking things so I kept it the way it was.
